## Framework Laptop

![](/images/Slack_FW_5uie1.png)

<br/>
I came across the Framework laptop a while ago when it was featured on
a number of articles ranging from  [Ars
Technica](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/07/frameworks-new-lightweight-modular-laptop-delivers-on-its-promises/),
[Tom's
Hardware](https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/framework-laptop-review-the-anti-macbook-has-arrived),
[CNET](https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/framework-laptop-review-a-functional-and-futureproof-13-inches/),
and
[iFixit](https://www.ifixit.com/News/51614/framework-laptop-teardown-10-10-but-is-it-perfect). This
coincided well with my search for a new laptop. The 2015 MBP 13 inch
Retina had really served me well for a while. It is a laptop that
introduced me to amazing battery power and the ability to work on a
portable system that did not require kid gloves. However, after five
years, the usual battery bulge and failure of speakers meant that it
became a challenge to continue with the laptop. While a number of
parts are available outside the "Apple Service Programme", sourcing
them, testing their quality and negotiating the use of the right parts
became a challenge. Additional challenges were posed as the new OS
upgrades that Apple released seemed to constantly [slow down](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/11/macos-big-sur-launch-appears-to-cause-temporary-slowdown-in-even-non-big-sur-macs/) the
system. This in itself isn't very surprising, my experience has been
that updates from Apple have continued to help improve the experience
(barring the minor hiccup due to my tooling). However, every couple of
updates have also meant that the demands on the hardware
increases. This is where Apple as pointed out by many customers and
proponents of sustainability needs to do more. The [fact](https://www.ifixit.com/Device/MacBook_Pro_13%22_Retina_Display_Early_2015) that there are
so many soldered, bolted, glued components with proprietary designs
actually makes it a nightmare for folks to upgrade and maintain the
hardware.

## What I need?

Given these struggles, I was not keen on buying another Apple device
as a primary device. I was looking at a device that would,
* Be eco-friendly by allowing for greater repairability
* Provide greater interoperability
* Respect privacy (remember Apple's wonderful
  [CSAM](https://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2021/08/24/apple-iphone-warning-ios-15-csam-privacy-upggrade-ios-macos-ipados-security/)
  approach?)
* Allow for sourcing parts easily and locally
* Does not require expensive service agreements or specific highly
  priced equipment for repair
* Greater storage capacity

## What do I give up?

While transitioning out of using an Apple device, I was willing to,
* Work with lesser battery life
* Spend a little time to tinker around with software as and when
  required
* Reworking my tooling (for personal and professional work)

## First Impressions

That being said, given the limited time that I have spend on the
Framework Laptop, I am impressed by,
* Build quality: Serious thought has gone into creating the laptop for
  long-term usage. A number of small portions (the additional screws,
  captive screws, the hinge stability, etc.) are a treat to encounter
  the first time.
* The ease of assembling: The packaging of a screw driver, presence of
  QR codes everywhere, use of standard screws, the availability of
  easily accessible tutorials and videos (many of them from the
  community) makes setting up the process a breeze.
* One of the tenets for this blog is "friendly community", I have been
  lurking on the various channels Framework has setup and it is
  remarkable to see how well the community has very quickly formed
  around this hardware. This reminds me of the early days of
  Hackintosh, a few FOSS projects and the Frankenpads.


## More to follow

I hope to continue to write about this laptop as I continue to use it,
a few quick thinks that I will post about shortly,
* Choice of SSD and RAM
* Choice of power adapter
* Setting up Linux
  * Choice of distribution
  * How-Tos
  * Gotchas
  * Wrapping up
* Setting up a VM with Windows 11 (for the obligatory requirements all
  of us have)
