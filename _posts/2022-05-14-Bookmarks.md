blurb: A static file storage for interesting websites/pages to replacement to a bookmarking system

[Delicious](https://del.icio.us/) was a mark of doing one thing and
only one thing, but doing it well *(I have deliberately linked to it
here, an homage to a service that was a joy to use)*. Sites such as
StumbleUpon, Diigo were a call back to the times when discovering
unconnected websites without having to give up privacy. Almost
everyone I know had a bookmarklet, a plugin or a custom setup to post
to del.icio.us. It was a service, that was rich and led to a number of
use cases. Almost anyone who wanted to learn text analysis and
information retrieval would use del.icio.us as a data set after having
been IP-banned from Wikipedia.

As is the case, the transition of del.icio.us to Yahoo! led to a
number of issues, breaking workflows that people had and eventually
being so buggy that it led to a number of alternatives and open-source
clones. The simplicity of the service also did mean that there were a
number of PHP, Perl and ASPX clones that survived beyond this phase of
multiple ownership transfers (AVOS being the disaster that ended
it). This transition between multiple owners also meant the identity
of the service was constantly under question, the focus of the service
always being compared with other budding services. It is also important
to note that this transition meant a steady stream of exits of users,
some who self-hosted, some who transitioned to clones, some who
started using paid services and  many who relied on alternatives that were
local storage (synced across devices, etc.). The death of the service
and the rise of "likes" based model of links or site recommendation is
an unsurprising co-occurrence. A simple act of bookmarking links of
note for personal use had now morphed  into a beastly game of
one-upmanship and sale of personal data.

I've tried multiple services since the demise of del.icio.us, but am
yet to find a viable alternative. I haven't been able to stick with
each workflow for more than a couple of months. I have finally found
an alternative that works for me now. I use Emacs (org-mode) with
Firefox to store my bookmarks locally and then convert them to a
simple YAML set that is then displayed on this site. The links are
available on this [site](bookmarks.html). And here's to hoping this
lasts for a longer time!
