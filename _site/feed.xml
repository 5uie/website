<p>After much dithering, I have finally found the time to setup a place to keep track of my use of new tools, the ascent into the Fediverse and a technical log as and when needed.</p>

<p>This site has been crafted to ensure that pages aren’t unnecessarily clunky, hard to read, and incredibly complex with multiple scripts on each site. I’ve followed the simple principles that allowed text sites to load fast, read fast and across different kinds of browsers and devices with ease. Some of the wonderful folk who have started this range from <a href="https://1mb.club/">1mb.club</a> to <a href="https://10kbclub.com">10kbclub.com</a>.</p>

<p>The blog has been setup using the idea of a <a href="https://john-doe.neocities.org/">single page template</a> as I do not foresee a large site at this point. The site is currently versioned on Github and then deployed through Netlify. In case the site reaches a <strong>target of 100 posts</strong>, it will then merit a domain name and a move to Sourcehut.</p>

<h3 id="why-is-it-anonymous">Why is it anonymous?</h3>
<p>My introduction to the internet was through Telnet, IRC and BBSes. I made a bunch of friends that I only knew by their respective handles or aliases. I do not really recall being bullied or harassed myself or witnessing this happen to anyone else on these rooms and servers. This is an experiment to check if it is possible to continue to have a friendly and inclusive community that can exist while being anonymous.</p>

<h3 id="social-web">Social web</h3>
<p>My meandering journey back into the world of technology has also meant I have now discovered federated social networks and a semplency of control for the users. The idea of control and power to host, moderate and curate all of our interactions on our own is a tempting idea. This is also an attempt at testing these new protocols and methods of connecting with each other.</p>

<p><em>More to follow</em>
While I have only created this blog today, this has been in the works for a while now. I will try and put together a bunch of material that has led me to finally setup this process soon,</p>

<ol>
  <li>Links to reading for simpler, quicker web.
    <ol>
      <li>Lesser frameworks and scripts</li>
      <li>Connected web</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Need for decentralised social media</li>
  <li>Eco-friendly and inclusive communities (as there is exhaustive resources available for privacy-first, cross-platform and open-source, I shall not be attempting to document it here.)</li>
