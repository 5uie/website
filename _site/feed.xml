only one thing, but doing it well <em>(I have deliberately linked to it
here, an homage to a service that was a joy to use)</em>. Sites such as
StumbleUpon, Diigo were a call back to the times when discovering
unconnected websites without having to give up privacy. Almost
everyone I know had a bookmarklet, a plugin or a custom setup to post
to del.icio.us. It was a service, that was rich and led to a number of
use cases. Almost anyone who wanted to learn text analysis and
information retrieval would use del.icio.us as a data set after having
been IP-banned from Wikipedia.</p>

<p>As is the case, the transition of del.icio.us to Yahoo! led to a
number of issues, breaking workflows that people had and eventually
being so buggy that it led to a number of alternatives and open-source
clones. The simplicity of the service also did mean that there were a
number of PHP, Perl and ASPX clones that survived beyond this phase of
multiple ownership transfers (AVOS being the disaster that ended
it). This transition between multiple owners also meant the identity
of the service was constantly under question, the focus of the service
always being compared with other budding services. It is also important
to note that this transition meant a steady stream of exits of users,
some who self-hosted, some who transitioned to clones, some who
started using paid services and  many who relied on alternatives that were
local storage (synced across devices, etc.). The death of the service
and the rise of “likes” based model of links or site recommendation is
an unsurprising co-occurrence. A simple act of bookmarking links of
note for personal use had now morphed  into a beastly game of
one-upmanship and sale of personal data.</p>

<p>I’ve tried multiple services since the demise of del.icio.us, but am
yet to find a viable alternative. I haven’t been able to stick with
each workflow for more than a couple of months. I have finally found
an alternative that works for me now. I use Emacs (org-mode) with
Firefox to store my bookmarks locally and then convert them to a
simple YAML set that is then displayed on this site. The links are
available on this <a href="bookmarks.html">site</a>. And here’s to hoping this
lasts for a longer time!</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="bookmarks" /><category term="emacs" /><category term="yaml" /><category term="delicious" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Delicious was a mark of doing one thing and only one thing, but doing it well (I have deliberately linked to it here, an homage to a service that was a joy to use).

In modern times, due to the demand and needs from different resume processing systems, multiple formats are often needed.</p>

<p>Over the course of two decades, I have only changed the format of my resume twice. It makes sense to create a template for multiple formats and then keep updating the text to generate the files in different formats.</p>

<p>In my use case, I have a need for publications to show up and to have a logo of the organisation I am representing in some cases. Additionally, I need to share the resume in PDF and DOCX based on the uses. While it might be possible for some users to convert/print/export a DOCX file as a PDF, this workflow is not possible for users without access to good word processing software. LaTeX<label><a href="">1</a>,<a href="">2</a></label> handles typesetting much better and supplies greater flexibility for customisation and therefore I chose this way. I did realise that having a web presence is important for folks now, therefore have added a HTML format too.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://pandoc.org/">pandoc</a> based workflow seemed to work best for me.</p>

<h2 id="workflow">Workflow</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Resume in markdown format</li>
  <li>Style files for HTML, LaTeX and DOCX</li>
  <li>References in a separate bib file</li>
  <li>Any added material (images, logos, etc.)</li>
  <li>Use pandoc to generate necessary outputs</li>
</ol>

<p>Problem with wrong names for committer or author on git for a number of commits? This can be fixed either by git rebase or by git filter-branch.</p>

<h2 id="fix">Fix</h2>

<p><em>Note of caution: This script will change SHA1s for all previous commits.</em></p>

<p>Create a shell script with +x permissions</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>#!/bin/sh
 
git filter-branch -f --env-filter '
 
an="$GIT_AUTHOR_NAME"

export GIT_AUTHOR_NAME=$an
export GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL=$am
export GIT_COMMITTER_NAME=$cn

<p>Once done, run the push command to update origin. Please note that this will override SHA1s irrevocably at origin</p>

<p>After much dithering, I have found the time to document my use of new tools, the ascent into the Fediverse and a technical log of this journey.</p>

<p>This site has been crafted to ensure that pages are not unnecessarily clunky, hard to make, and incredibly complex with multiple scripts for each task. I have followed simple principles that allow text sites to load and render quickly, maintain consistency across different browsers and devices with ease. Some of the wonderful folk who have follow these ideas range from <a href="https://1mb.club/">1mb.club</a> to <a href="https://10kbclub.com">10kbclub.com</a>.</p>

<p>This website has been setup using the idea of a <a href="https://john-doe.neocities.org/">single page template</a> as I do not foresee a large site at this point. The site is currently versioned on GitHub and then deployed through Netlify. In case the site reaches a target of <strong>100 posts</strong>, it may then merit a domain name and a move to a better templating system. It will continue to follow the ideas of a simpler, lighter, and better web.</p>

<h3 id="why-is-it-anonymous">Why is it anonymous?</h3>
<p>My introduction to the internet was through Telnet, IRC, Listserv and BBS. I made a bunch of friends that who knew each other by their respective handles or aliases. I do not really recall being bullied or harassed myself or witnessing this happen to anyone else on these rooms and servers regularly. Yes, occasional incidents did occur, what was interesting was the way such problems were handled, and the community continued to function after it. This is an experiment to see if it is possible to continue to have a friendly and inclusive community that can exist while being anonymous (and therefore respecting the need for privacy).</p>

<h3 id="social-web">Social web</h3>
<p>My meandering path back into the world of technology has also meant I have now discovered federated social networks and a semblance of control/power for the users. While the idea of the power to host, moderate and curate all our interactions on our own is seductive, the cost to do so, in terms of time, effort and skills required seems to be high. This is an attempt to test these new protocols and methods of remaining connected with each other.</p>

<p><em>More to follow</em></p>

<p>While I have only created this blog today, this has been in the works for a while now. I will try and put together a bunch of material that has led me to finally set this up,</p>

<ol>
  <li>Why do we need a simpler, quicker web?
    <ol>
      <li>Lesser frameworks and scripts</li>
      <li>The need for a connected web</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Need for decentralised social media</li>
  <li>Eco-friendly and inclusive communities (as there are exhaustive resources available for privacy-first, cross-platform and open-source, I shall not be attempting to document it here.)</li>
